      content: "We are thrilled to share our incredible journey with Kulaabhooshanam, the adoption portal that brought our family together. Our son, Aryan, came into our lives through this wonderful agency. Aryan was a bright 4-year-old boy, full of curiosity and laughter, when we adopted him. He faced some initial challenges, having been through a tough time after being orphaned due to a tragic accident. Yet 3 years later today, Aryan shares his love for Bollywood music with his sister and refuses to go to bed without a snuggle from us. We're grateful to Kulaabhooshanam along with the Ministry of Women and Child Development for helping us become a complete family.",

      content: "We can't express how grateful we are to Kulaabhooshanam and the Ministry of Women and Child Development for helping us find our loving daughter, Maya. When we adopted her at the age of 6, she had faced a tough past and had spent her early years in an orphanage. Though the initial transition was challenging, the warmth of our family and the support of these organizations helped her adjust seamlessly. Today, Maya is a cheerful and loving 10-year-old who has enriched our lives. She loves learning classical Indian music, and her grace and passion light up our home. It's been 4 amazing years since she joined our family.",

        content: "Our hearts are overflowing with gratitude to Kulaabhooshanam, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, and the universe for bringing our little bundle of joy, Aarav, into our lives. Aarav became a part of our family when he was just 9 months old. Although he had a rocky start, with his biological parents facing difficulties, Aarav's journey to our home was swift and smooth, thanks to these incredible organizations. Today, at 2 years old, he's a little ball of energy and laughter. He's already begun to enjoy the soothing sounds of the cuckoo bird each morning  and we're excited to introduce him to our rich musical culture as he grows. It's been 1 incredible year since he joined our family, and every day with him is a blessing.",

        content: "I always wondered if I could provide a loving and nurturing home for a child as a single mother. Thanks to Kulaabhooshanam and the Ministry of Women and Child Development, I found my little angel, Nima. When Nima, a bright-eyed 2-year-old, entered my life, I was overwhelmed by her innocence and resilience. Over the past 3 years, she has filled my home with laughter and love. We love to enjoy rain dances together and play hide and seek when the weather is strong. Nima's presence has been a blessing, and I'm grateful for every single day we spend together.",

        content: "Our journey with Kulaabhooshanam began when we met Aarav, a 7-year-old boy who had faced tremendous challenges due to Down Syndrome â€“ a genetic disorder. His bright eyes held dreams of a brighter future, and we were determined to provide him with the love and care he needed. Thanks to the Ministry of Women and Child Development, our lives changed forever. Aarav, who was 7 years old when he entered our lives, is now 12 and thriving. His wordless ways of expressing his love for us and for crackers on Diwali has enriched our lives. Despite the initial hurdles, our family feels complete with Aarav, who is the embodiment of resilience and hope. We owe our happiness to Kulaabhooshanam and the Ministry.",
